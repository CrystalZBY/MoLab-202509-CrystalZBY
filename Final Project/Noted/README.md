## Goal
- A mobile app that tracks not just mood, but also the life factors that impacts mood. Tracking the life factors, including activities done after wake-up, pre-sleep, how we eat & what we eat, sleep duration, can bring awareness to our body and mind. As data entries accumulates and displayed with data visualization graphs and highlights, we can gradually form a self-care system that optimizes wellbeing.
